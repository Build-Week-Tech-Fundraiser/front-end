## ‚òùÔ∏è Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?
They want to build a platform that provides tech entrepreneurs with limited resources access to business training, project capital raising and mentoring.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Sharing and exposing projects to help fund users.

- What is the mission statement?

    To help underrepresented groups who wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have access to technology.

## üí° Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
1. Registration and login capabilities for a `user`.
2. As a `fundraiser` I can create a `project` to start fundraising.
3. As a `funder` I can browse the page and find `projects` I would like to fund.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
1. Integrate a payment service (Stripe, for example ) to donate to a `project`.
2. Authenticated `user` can set up push notifications to be triggered when a particular `fundraiser` reaches a certain percentage of and / or reaches its `goal`.
3. An authenticated `user` can upload `image`s. If no `user` `image` is provided, a placeholder `image` populates the view. 

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
    - have a subscription
    - have a tier system that you buy into
    - have a recommended section/ browse categories
